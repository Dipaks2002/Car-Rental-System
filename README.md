## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

##Information About Project :

this project implements a basic car rental system in Java. It allows users to rent and return cars through a menu-driven interface. The system maintains a list of available cars and customers, and it calculates rental prices based on the number of rental days and the base price per day for each car. Users can rent a car by providing their name and selecting an available car, and they can return a rented car by entering its ID. The system provides feedback on successful transactions and handles errors such as invalid inputs or unavailable cars.
